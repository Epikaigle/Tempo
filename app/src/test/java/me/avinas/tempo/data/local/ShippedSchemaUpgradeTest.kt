/**
 * The upgrade every existing user is about to take, from every schema that ever shipped to the
 * one this build compiles.
 *
 * Release 4.8.15 skips three unreleased schema steps: 55 is what v4.8.11 shipped, and 56, 57 and
 * 58 were only ever built locally, so they arrive as one squashed migration out of 55. That
 * squash is the reason this test exists at all -- it is the only migration in the chain that
 * three releases' worth of work lands in at once -- but it is not the whole risk. Anyone still on
 * 4.8.3, 4.8.7 or 4.8.10 upgrades through the entire chain in one open, so the sweep starts at
 * schema 43 and walks every shipped schema up to the current one, carrying a real library.
 *
 * Each case builds its database from the schema Room itself exported for that version
 * ([ShippedSchemas]), so the "before" state is the one a real install of that release has rather
 * than a hand-typed approximation that can drift. It then seeds a library with the shapes that
 * break careless migrations -- duplicate re-saves, replays under one session, plays either side
 * of a date line, NULL session ids, unicode and apostrophes, a podcast beside the music -- runs
 * the real migration objects through the same SQLite the app runs, and checks four things:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing is missing.** Every row of every table survives the upgrade, except the exact
 *    rows three migrations are documented to remove (the 53->54 challenge dedupe, the 54->55
 *    listening-event dedupe) and those removals are verified one by one, not counted.
 * 2. **Nothing is silently rewritten.** Every surviving row still carries the same values in
 *    every column it had before, and every column the upgrade adds lands on the default the
 *    schema declares -- so an upgrade cannot quietly reset a preference or a watch count.
 * 3. **The past still renders as it did.** The per-play timezone offset backfilled by 55->58 must
 *    reproduce, for every row, the local day and hour the old `'localtime'` queries produced.
 *    Different day boundaries would change streaks, Night Owl and Early Bird *because* of the
 *    upgrade.
 * 4. **Room will accept it.** The end state is compared table by table, column by column, index
 *    by index and foreign key by foreign key against the exported current schema -- the same
 *    comparison Room's `onValidateSchema` makes at open time. A mismatch here is the crash on
 *    launch that a destructive fallback would have papered over with an empty library.
