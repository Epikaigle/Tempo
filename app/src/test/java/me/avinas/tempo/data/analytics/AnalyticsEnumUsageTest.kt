/**
 * Fails the build when a schema enum value has no production call site.
 *
 * This exists because the schema accumulated values nobody could ever send. `TrackingGapReason`
 * carried five reasons while the only call site passed one, `RunPhase.STARTED` was never
 * passed at all, `GrantVia.SETTINGS` was declared while `via` was hardcoded to `ONBOARDING`,
 * and `AccessResult.DENIED` — the single most useful thing that event could report — was
 * unreachable. Each of those looked like a working dimension in the published list and read as
 * a constant in the data, and review discipline had not caught any of them.
 *
 * A reference check rather than a runtime one, because the question is whether a value *can* be
 * sent, and only the source knows that.
