/**
 * The complete analytics vocabulary — everything Tempo is ever allowed to report.
 *
 * Design rules, enforced by `AnalyticsSchemaTest` rather than by review discipline:
 *  - Properties are enum names or bucketed values. There are no free-form string
 *    properties, so a caller physically cannot send a track title, artist name, search
 *    query, notification text or file path.
 *  - Numbers are bucketed. This avoids fingerprinting and keeps dashboards stable when
 *    a user's library grows. Bucketing is why small enum-like counts must be enums
 *    instead — a value of 1, 2 or 3 all collapse into `1-5`, carrying no information.
 *  - Keys stay short and snake_case, and values are only String or Int. Nothing structured
 *    or nested, so an event cannot smuggle a payload inside a property.
 *  - Keys stay under 40 characters, which the analytics backend accepts.
 *
 * Never add an identifier here. The pseudonymous install id is attached by the transport as
 * its routing key, never as a property — see `PostHogClient` — so this vocabulary stays free
 * of identifiers entirely.
