/**
 * Emits the once-a-day active-use marker, and remembers that it did.
 *
 * Called from wherever the user proves they used Tempo today: opening the app, or a play
 * being committed by the tracking service. Whichever happens first wins and the rest of the
 * day's calls are no-ops, so a device opened five times still contributes exactly one active
 * day — which is the whole difference between counting users and counting taps.
 *
 * An in-memory mirror of "what has already gone out today" short-circuits every call after
 * the first, so this is safe to call from a per-play path without paying a disk read each
 * time. The mirror is a cache, never the source of truth: it starts empty in every process
 * and the ledger is consulted the first time through.
 *
 * Failures are swallowed on purpose. A missing presence marker costs one day of one metric;
 * an exception escaping into app start-up or a media callback would cost the user their
 * tracking.
