/**
 * An app that produced media Tempo refused to track because it is not on any allowlist.
 *
 * Tempo tracks only apps it knows to be music sources (curated defaults plus anything the
 * user added). Previously the rule was inverted — everything was tracked unless it matched a
 * blocklist — which meant any app that posted a media-style notification (Viber voice notes,
 * Signal voice messages, voicemail) was journaled as a song and pinned to the foreground
 * notification.
 *
 * Default-deny alone would leave those users with no way to discover why their player went
 * silent, so every rejected media session is recorded here. The Manage Apps screen lists these
 * as "Detected — not tracked" with a one-tap Allow, which turns the allowlist from a dead end
 * into a review queue.
 *
 * Display names are deliberately NOT stored: the package label is resolved from PackageManager
 * at render time so it stays correct after an app is renamed or updated.
