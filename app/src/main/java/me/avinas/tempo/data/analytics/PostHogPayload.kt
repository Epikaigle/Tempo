/**
 * Builds the PostHog capture request body.
 *
 * Written with an explicit [JsonWriter] rather than reflection so that **exactly** which bytes
 * leave the device is visible in one short, readable function. If you want to audit what Tempo
 * sends, this is the file to read.
 *
 * Three things here are load-bearing for privacy rather than formatting:
 *
 *  - **`$process_person_profile: false` on every event.** This is what makes an event anonymous
 *    at PostHog rather than identified: no person profile is created, no person properties can
 *    be attached, and the event is stored without a user record. It is written first, before
 *    any other property, so an audit cannot miss it.
 *  - **`$geoip_disable: true` on every event.** PostHog would otherwise turn the caller's
 *    address into a country, region and city and keep them. This is the switch that keeps the
 *    published "no location" promise true now that events go straight to PostHog.
 *  - **The install id is the transport-level `distinct_id`, never an event property.** It is
 *    what makes DAU/MAU countable across days, and keeping it out of `properties` is why the
 *    schema's ban on identifier-shaped property keys still holds unchanged.
 *
 * `$device_model` is emitted only on crashes. Device model is the highest-entropy
 * quasi-identifier Tempo holds, and paired with a stable install id it is the field most
 * likely to make a small user base re-identifiable — so it is kept where it actually earns its
 * place (crash triage, where "which devices break" is the question) and withheld everywhere
 * else.
