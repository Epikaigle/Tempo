/**
 * Sends queued events to a PostHog-compatible ingest endpoint.
 *
 * The protocol is a plain POST of a JSON batch, which is why this stays ~150 auditable lines in
 * our own repo rather than a dependency on PostHog's Android SDK: anyone can read exactly what
 * Tempo transmits, and the SDK's autocapture and session-replay surface — which we would only
 * have to switch off again — never enters the build at all.
 *
 * [BuildConfig.ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT] is a **full URL**, so the same client talks to PostHog's
 * batch endpoint (`https://eu.i.posthog.com/batch/`) or to any compatible ingest URL. There is
 * deliberately no intermediary service: events go straight from the device to PostHog, and the
 * privacy guarantees that matter are enforced here — the anonymous flag and `$geoip_disable` —
 * rather than by something the client has to trust.
 *
 * Privacy properties enforced here:
 *  - Reporting requires both a configured build and the user's consent, checked before every
 *    single enqueue *and* every flush.
 *  - Events are anonymous: the payload sets `$process_person_profile = false`, so PostHog
 *    creates no person profile for this install.
 *  - No location is derived from the connection: the payload sets `$geoip_disable = true`, so
 *    PostHog stores no country, region or city for the caller.
 *  - The only identity transmitted is the pseudonymous install id, as the transport-level
 *    `distinct_id`. It never becomes an event property.
 *  - Failures are swallowed. A failed send leaves events queued, and they expire after 24h; a
 *    rejection the endpoint will never accept (a bad token, say) drops the batch instead of
 *    retrying it for a day, and says so in logcat.
