/**
 * Repository interface for accessing enriched metadata.
 * 
 * This repository follows the "Enrichment → Database → UI" pattern:
 * - Enrichment services (MusicBrainz, Spotify) write data via this repository
 * - UI components read cached data from this repository (never make direct API calls)
 * - All data access goes through Room database for offline-first behavior
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Minimizes API requests by serving cached data to UI
 * - Single source of truth for enriched metadata
 * - UI always has fast access to cached data
 * - Background enrichment keeps data fresh without blocking UI
